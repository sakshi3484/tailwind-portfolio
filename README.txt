Project: Personal Portfolio Website
Built using HTML and Tailwind CSS as part of the DevTown Bootcamp.

This project is a personal portfolio website that includes a Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact section. It also includes my resume, a profile photo, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. The layout is fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

I created this using only HTML and Tailwind CSS, without custom CSS or JS. Through this project, I learned how to organize files, build a responsive layout, and use Tailwind utility classes to style a complete webpage.
